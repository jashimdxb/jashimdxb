        <p>Why do we use it?
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted
             by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
             The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
             normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content
              here, content here', making it look like readable English.
               Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now 
               use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search 
               for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
                infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes
                by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
